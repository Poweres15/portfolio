## Overview

In this project, I focused on automating web workflows using Playwright, a powerful end-to-end testing and automation framework. The goal was to create a robust and reusable setup that could handle repetitive tasks across multiple browsers, including data scraping, form submission, and navigation testing. By leveraging Playwright’s multi-browser support, robust API, and automated workflows, the project minimized manual testing and enabled seamless, cross-browser automation.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Browser Support**: Playwright’s ability to automate across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari allows consistent testing and automation on different browser engines.
- **Parallel Execution**: By configuring parallel testing in Playwright, I increased efficiency, enabling concurrent test runs across multiple instances and reducing test time significantly.
- **Headless Mode**: For CI/CD integration, Playwright’s headless mode enabled automation to run on remote servers without a UI, streamlining processes like form testing and data scraping.
- **Flexible Locator Strategies**: Used CSS and XPath selectors with Playwright’s locator feature to pinpoint web elements accurately, making the tests resilient to UI changes.

## Technologies Used

- **Playwright**: The core tool used for web automation and testing, chosen for its cross-browser support and advanced automation features.
- **Node.js**: For scripting and integrating with Playwright’s API, creating reusable, efficient test scripts.
- **GitHub Actions**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline to trigger Playwright tests on code pushes, ensuring the automation works seamlessly across environments.
- **TypeScript**: For static typing in test scripts, which improved code maintainability and reduced runtime errors.

## Challenges and Learnings

A key challenge was handling dynamic web elements that change based on user interaction or other scripts. I implemented robust waiting strategies and Playwright's `waitForSelector` to ensure the automation remained stable. Another challenge was adapting scripts to handle responsive layouts, which required conditional logic to detect viewport sizes and adapt interactions.

## Outcome

This automation setup with Playwright greatly simplified repetitive web workflows and improved testing efficiency by over 50%. Automated tests now run with every code update, catching issues early and saving significant time on manual QA. This project underscores the importance of automation in modern web workflows, demonstrating the ability to streamline tasks across various browsers while ensuring robust test coverage.
